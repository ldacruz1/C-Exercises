# Exercises

This is a conjunction of many coding problems done in my C++ class in college. There are basic concepts exercises, and more advanced implementation of these concepts.
Also, there are some games such as word games, random 8-ball generator, etc. Basic calculations can be performed by some exercises, and some more advanced ones.

Have a C++ compiler such as Eclipse.
